# Phase 30 Controlled Production Foundation Results

Date: 2026-07-27

## Implementation result

- Added a fail-closed production controller for immutable release identity,
  maintenance/change metadata, rollback ownership, explicit external or
  integrated-encrypted backup strategy, serial-only deployment, tenant
  continuity, operational thresholds, evidence, and automatic previous-image
  rollback.
- Added a read-only production T9 command. It verifies platform contracts,
  schema family/version, serial inventory, journal balance, reports, and
  privacy-preserving business-data fingerprints without posting transactions.
- Added Phase 30 release contracts to the mandatory static CI job.
- Updated the protected production deployment to use the Phase 30 controller.
- The controller never provisions a quantity tenant.

|---|---:|
| Phase 27 release contracts | 11/11 PASS |
| Phase 28 recovery contracts | 14/14 PASS |

| T4 serial regression | 51/51 PASS |
| T5 quantity staging regression | 20/20 PASS |
| T6 mixed-family isolation | 17/17 PASS |
| Selected T7 smoke | PASS |
| Runtime hardening | 5/5 PASS |
| Final release preflight and Redis health | PASS |

The rehearsal used a disposable production-mode stack. Its serial tenant
retained the exact same continuity and table-count fingerprints across
hardening, its journal remained balanced, and no quantity tenant was created by
the Phase 30 path. The broader staging suite creates temporary quantity tenants
only after the Phase 30 comparison and deletes them before final preflight.

## Exit-gate handling

Implementation and rehearsal found no P0/P1 regression. Actual paying-customer
continuity can only be certified by manually approving the protected production
job with valid maintenance and rollback metadata. The job will either
produce matching before/after evidence or automatically select the rehearsed
rollback path. Phase 31 must not begin until that production job passes.
