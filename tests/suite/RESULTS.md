# Full-System Test Suite — Results

Latest run: 2026-07-01, inside the Docker `web` container against both active
tenants (`tenant_company_1`, `tenant_company_2`).

Command:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec web python tests/suite/run_all.py
```

Outcome:

```text
ALL MODULES PASSED.
```

Every real (non-known-bug) check passes on both tenants. Confirmed defects are
tracked as `XFAIL` and excluded from the exit code (see "Known bugs" below).

Totals: **248** real checks on tenant_company_1, **252** on tenant_company_2,
**70** HTTP checks — **570** real checks, all passing.

## What each module verifies

### `test_parties.py` (masters)
Creates Customer / Vendor / Both / Expense parties; verifies the Expense party
auto-creates an Expense chart-of-accounts row and AR/AP wiring by type; opening
balances post a balanced journal and yield the correct party balance
(Debit customer → +opening, Credit vendor → −opening); rename + opening change
rebuilds the opening journal; `get_party_by_name`, `get_parties_json`,
`get_party_balances_json`, `get_expense_party_balances_json`, and unknown-party
lookup all behave.

### `test_items.py` (masters)
Item create with category/brand, update by `item_id`, `get_item_by_name`,
`get_items_json`, `get_item_stock_by_name` reflecting a purchase, and the active
autocomplete query. `get_item_names_like` is probed as a documented broken
helper.

### `test_purchases.py`
Create → serials in stock, invoice total = qty×price, journal debits Inventory
and credits the vendor AP (balance −total); `get_current_purchase`,
navigation, `get_purchase_summary`; `validate_purchase_update2` for price-only
and unsold-serial replacement; the **delete guard** (delete blocked when a serial
is sold, allowed for an untouched invoice).

### `test_sales.py`
Credit sale → AR +total, Revenue credited, COGS posted at cost; re-selling a sold
serial blocked; **qty ≠ serial-count rejected**; fetch/navigation/summary;
invoice update; update/delete blocked once a return exists; cash sale (where the
`is_cash` feature exists) debits Cash and leaves the party AR at 0.

### `test_returns.py`
Sale return (partial), reversing revenue and restoring stock, lowering customer
AR; wrong-customer and duplicate returns blocked; return update/delete; purchase
return with accounting and stock, wrong-vendor blocked; **sold-serial and
double purchase-return guards** (drift-tolerant, see below); summaries and
navigation.

### `test_cash_movement.py`
Payment to a vendor raises AP toward zero by the amount; update/delete reverse
correctly; invalid amount rejected. Receipt from a customer lowers AR by the
amount; details/history/delete. Contra between two parties; same-party contra
rejected; update/delete. Trial balance stays balanced after each.

### `test_opening.py`
Opening cash singleton debits Cash / credits Owner's Capital (restored to the
original afterward); negative rejected. Opening stock debits Inventory / credits
Opening Balance, with duplicate-serial and existing-serial guards, list/details/
delete. Reclassification moves the Opening Balance account to Owner's Capital and
zeroes it.

### `test_owner_equity.py`
Injection raises Owner's Capital, withdrawal lowers it (both balanced); listing;
invalid direction / non-positive amount / unknown equity account rejected;
deleting both restores capital.

### `test_month_close.py`
Preview (no mutation); close records `period_closes` and posts a balanced entry;
invalid month and duplicate close rejected; listing; reverse reopens the period.
Self-restoring so the run is repeatable.

### `test_reports.py` (every report)
Accounts: `get_trial_balance_json`, `vw_trial_balance` nets to zero,
`detailed_ledger`/`detailed_ledger2`, cash ledger, AR/AP, party & expense
balances (customer net AR value checked). Stock: `stock_summary` quantity checked
against the in-stock serial count, `stock_report`, `stock_worth_report`, item
history, item stock, last-purchase/last-sale views. Serial: all four serial
ledgers/details. Sales analytics: summary, product/customer profitability,
sales-by-product/customer, sale-wise profit (json + table + view),
trend, invoice register, company-worth view. Monthly: company position, income
statement. Dashboard: all 15 `fn_dash_*` functions and the 4 `vw_dash_*` views.

### `test_http.py`
Drives real Django views as a logged-in tenant user: home, master dashboards,
opening/owner-equity/month-close/opening-stock/sales-reports pages return 200;
all dashboard, list, and report JSON APIs return no 5xx; `current_user` works;
a party is created through the real endpoint; logout responds. (Adds a temporary
membership for the superuser if needed and removes it afterward.)

## Known bugs (XFAIL) — real defects surfaced by the suite

All are **tenant schema drift**: idempotent patches under `tenancy/sql/` applied
to one tenant but not the other. They do not fail the suite; they document work
to do.

| # | Finding | Where | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `create_purchase_return` has no in-stock guard: a sold serial can be purchase-returned and serials can be double-returned | `tenant_company_1` (works on `tenant_company_2`) | apply `tenancy/sql/fix_return_serial_integrity*.sql` to `tenant_company_1` |
| 2 | Cash-party feature absent (`is_cash` column, `get_cash_party_id`) | `tenant_company_1` | apply the cash-party patches to `tenant_company_1` |
| 3 | `item_history_view` missing | `tenant_company_2` (present on `tenant_company_1`) | recreate the view on `tenant_company_2` |
| 4 | `item_transaction_history(text)` 1-arg overload is ambiguous (collides with a 3-arg-with-defaults variant) | `tenant_company_1` | drop the redundant overload / align signatures |
| 5 | `get_item_names_like` broken on PostgreSQL 16 (ambiguous `item_name`) — dead code, active autocomplete uses an inline query | both tenants | qualify the column or remove the unused function |

After applying the relevant patch to the lagging tenant, the corresponding
`XFAIL` will report `XPASS`; remove the `known_bug`/`expect_block`/`xfail` marker
in the test at that point.

## Conventions

- Runs against **every** active tenant; one representative membership per schema.
- Names are unique per run and per process; repeated runs never collide.
- Expected-failure and destructive-guard probes run in a rolled-back
  transaction, so a wrongly-successful call never persists.
- The suite leaves its valid, uniquely-named accounting trail in place (like the
  deep lifecycle test); use tenant reset for a pristine dataset.
