# Phase 3B — Protected executor candidate

**Date:** 2026-09-03

**Scope:** the owner authorized preparing and testing the protected executor
locally. No push, production dispatch, cleanup, reversal or deployment was
authorized or performed in this work. Phase 3B is still incomplete; the owner
must manually verify production after an eventual approved cleanup.

The accepted read-only target evidence is in `PHASE3B_CONTROLLED_CLEANUP_RESULTS.md`:
run `33773691381`, source `a70f8a1`, deployed image `497b665`, target digest
`f29440c28fb0acf2640e9a9794918d5adf932cf8a4a2932b0e9b9dacd114b4b4`.
Its 14 quantity permissions/14 direct grants, redundant column and absence of
stale feature entries/orphan schemas remain the proposed scope, not permanent
execution authorization. No fresh production state was assumed or queried here.

## Implemented components

- `deploy/phase3b_cleanup_remote.py`: explicit apply/restore controller with
  exact image/source/core identity, reviewed target digest, typed confirmation,
  UTC maintenance window, attending recovery owner, root/shared-host-lock,
  capacity and helper-hash gates. Fresh managed encrypted backup and isolated
  action/reverse/action rehearsal must finish and remove their resources before
  a single live mutation is sent. Production is rechecked afterward, including
  failure paths. There is no automatic retry, reversal or production restart.
- `deploy/phase3b_cleanup_bundle.py`: checksummed, exact-source-SHA-bound stdin
  transport for controller, recovery helpers and checksum-pinned core.
  Source is not copied into the production container or host checkout.
- `deploy/phase3_recovery_remote.py`: two backward-compatible additions only:
  optional subprocess stdin and optional restored-stack verifier. With no
  verifier, the previous recovery workflow retains its original audits and
  cleanup. With the new verifier, the same resource/image/isolation safeguards
  and guaranteed cleanup surround contracted-state tests. Host shell helpers,
  existing service configuration and backup destinations are unchanged.
- `phase3b-controlled-cleanup.yml`: manual-only maintenance with synthetic
  runner tests followed by protected `production` approval; serialized with
  production deployment/recovery. Inputs require an explicit digest, action,
  confirmation, exact image, window and owner. The workflow cannot run on push.
- CI adds executor contracts/units and encrypted executor rehearsal to the
  existing mandatory cleanup gate; existing publication/deployment gates remain.

Final review identified additional internal-FK cascade paths that the initial
`a70f8a1` guard did not explicitly reject: a foreign table referencing direct/
group assignments, the archive state, or company feature lists. The core now
rejects all such incoming dependencies inside its existing read-only inspection
and under transaction locks during mutation. New negative PostgreSQL fixtures
cover both assignment-delete cascades, feature-update cascades and archive-state
update cascades. It also requires the exact permission/assignment columns and
types from the reviewed bootstrap, rejecting unknown columns, custom checks and
table inheritance: otherwise an unarchived extension could be lost during
retirement/reversal. This adds only precondition reads; archive/delete/restore/column
mutation SQL is unchanged. A **new protected read-only inspection is required**
before execution approval, even if the target digest remains unchanged.

The new core is pinned to SHA-256
`9699731c843b02c213c99cb4efaa8c79d75dcd6c7fb3752d0b03816b876a1a00`.
No serial business code, UI, models, tenant SQL, migration, runtime dependency,
Docker image definition or application entrypoint changed.

## Explicit failure semantics

The controller durably records `not_attempted`, then `unknown` before sending
a mutation, and `confirmed_committed` only after the core returns success.
An uncertain response never means assumed rollback. Later failed health or
fingerprint checks leave the overall result FAIL even when mutation committed.
Private failure diagnostics and attending-owner details remain root-only;
only controlled status metadata reaches workflow output.

The worker's 90-second deadline executes inside the container, independently
of the Docker client's 120-second timeout. A local injected delay after the
archive/delete/column-drop statements demonstrated real PostgreSQL rollback
when that worker deadline fires. This does not claim that SIGKILL, host loss or
a lost response always permits certainty; those require attended inspection.

Maintenance takes table locks briefly and can delay requests. Lock wait is two
seconds; statements are bounded at 30 seconds. A zero-interruption guarantee is
not made. The maintenance window and named attending owner still need explicit
user choices before production dispatch; neither is invented by the candidate.

## Validation and coverage

Controller unit tests exercise missing/wrong authority, source/image/core
mismatches, window expiry, missing owner, private durable status, real local
host-lock contention, shell argument quoting, malformed inspector output,
uncertified continuity, backup/restore/storage failure, target/container drift,
single-write sequencing, ambiguous write responses, post-commit drift and
post-commit health failure. Both apply and restore paths are covered. Existing
recovery tests also cover the optional verifier's failure cleanup and stdin path.

Real Docker integration uses the actual published ARM64 3A web image, local
PostgreSQL/Redis images, and only synthetic data in isolated UUID projects.
It seeds all 14 direct quantity grants, exercises streamed read/write transport,
verifies a post-DDL deadline rolls back the original state, takes a locally
encrypted backup, and performs apply → restore → apply on its restored copy.
It then cleans the synthetic source, takes a new encrypted backup of that
contracted database, and performs restore → apply → restore on another copy.
Both copies run the unmodified published image's normal startup and retain
their metadata state, serial structures and financial-continuity fingerprints.
The original default recovery path is also rerun from the first encrypted backup.

These are **not** calls to the production executor entry point, production
service manager or GitHub backup publisher. Full controller sequencing is
unit-tested with those external boundaries mocked; the transport, PostgreSQL
transactions, encryption/decryption, restore helper, resource limits and
disposable image startup are exercised for real. The future protected production
run must additionally verify a new remote backup and actual host image IDs.

The local PostgreSQL image is 16.15; the inspected production host reported
16.14. No equivalence is assumed from tags: the production controller pins
actual running image IDs. Published ARM64 web image ID remains
`sha256:6cb14f877396118ccdae4b75f0bdef95861276e8bd1d31802acf86e8a1b8c6bc`.

Earlier executor and 55-/62-check regression rehearsals passed before final
guard review. The final strengthened-source evidence is recorded below; the
earlier local results are not used as substitutes for rerunning this candidate.

Apply and restore round trips passed, including actual published-image restart
and unchanged isolated serial/financial-continuity fingerprints. The managed
helper measured database-restore RTOs of 44 seconds before apply and 45 seconds
before reversal; these are not full workflow durations or production RTO claims.
The original no-callback recovery path also passed, with helper RTO 45 seconds.
The injected in-container deadline occurred after destructive DDL and exact
original metadata was verified restored by PostgreSQL transaction rollback.

The harness confirmed removal, and independent exact-label Docker queries
confirmed no containers, volumes or networks remain for those four projects
or the final full-regression source project. Private synthetic environments and
passphrases were removed. Logs and encrypted synthetic fixtures remain outside Git.

```

A direct source comparison with `a70f8a1` verified that `make_archive`, `apply`,
`restore` and `operate` are byte-identical function bodies. Only inspection
preconditions changed in the core. This narrows the behavior change but does
not waive the required new read-only production inspection.

## Release boundary

The operator procedure is `PHASE3B_MAINTENANCE_RUNBOOK.md`. Because this is an
explicit maintenance transaction with no image change, its dedicated runner
gate executes full serial regression, core failures, executor encrypted recovery,
release/backup contracts and controller units before the protected production
gate. The actual production-image recovery/round-trip rehearsal runs after that
approval but **before** any live mutation. This is a documented refinement of
the earlier image-release/staging plan, not a bypass of production approval.

Next: review the exact local diff and authorize its `[skip ci]` push. Run and
review the stronger protected read-only inspector. Separately approve the exact
cleanup scope/digest, provide the attended UTC window and
rollback owner, then authorize workflow dispatch and protected execution.
Any changed target state, failed rehearsal, unresolved reviewer concern or
expired window stops the operation. No blanket future cleanup authority is
inferred. After an approved cleanup, STOP for owner manual production PASS.
