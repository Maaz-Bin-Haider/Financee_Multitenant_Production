# Generated from the exact authentication 0001-0025 history with Django 6.0.6.
"""First-release serial-only replacement for the authentication history.

The original migration files remain beside this replacement during checkpoint
4A. Existing installations that already applied them perform no operations.
Fresh installations execute this migration and create only permissions used by
the serial application; the retired quantity-company permissions are excluded.
