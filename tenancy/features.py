"""
tenancy.features
================
Per-company feature flags, controlled from the admin panel.

Every module has a switch: the core modules (Dashboard and its widgets,
Sales, Purchases, both returns, Payments, Receipts, Contra, Items, Parties),
every report group and sub-report, the add-on modules (Draft Invoices and its
screens, Opening Stock, Opening Cash, Owner Equity, Month-End Close), PDF
generation, CSV/Excel export and document attachments. Disabled features
disappear from the tenant UI (sidebar links, dashboard widgets, in-page report
buttons, PDF/export buttons, attachment widget) and their URLs are blocked by
``TenantSchemaMiddleware``.

Storage: ``Company.disabled_features`` (public schema, JSON list of disabled
feature keys). A key is either a group (``"stock_reports"``) or
``"group.sub"`` (``"stock_reports.serial_ledger"``). Disabling a group disables
all of its sub-features regardless of their own keys. A key that is not in the
list is enabled, so the list is exactly what is switched off.

Defaults: a NEW company starts with ``default_disabled_features()`` — the
plan's default set, everything in ``DEFAULT_DISABLED_FEATURES`` switched off.
The defaults are written when the company is created (admin add form,
``provision_tenant``), never read at request time, so existing companies keep
exactly what they have. The model field keeps ``default=list`` on purpose:
changing it would need a migration, which the migration-history gates refuse.
The example "Company One" created on a fresh install keeps every feature.

No tenant SQL is involved: like subscription control, this is registry data.
