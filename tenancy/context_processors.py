tenancy.context_processors
==========================
Expose the subscription warning banner and the per-company feature flags to
every tenant template.

``TenantSchemaMiddleware`` stamps ``request.subscription_state`` for
authenticated tenant users whose company is not blocked. Only the
``expiring`` (renewal due soon) and ``grace`` (expired, blocked soon)
states surface a banner; blocked states never reach a normal template
because the middleware short-circuits them to the suspension page.

    ``features`` — nested {group: {enabled, subs: {sub: bool}}} used both for
    template conditions and (via the ``json_script`` filter in base.html) as
    ``window.FinanceeFeatures``, which JS-built toolbars read to hide
    CSV/Excel export buttons. It must be passed to ``json_script`` as the raw
    dict — pre-serializing it with ``json.dumps`` double-encodes it into a
    string and the JS feature checks silently fail open. Off-tenant requests
    get an all-enabled map so shared pages render unchanged.
