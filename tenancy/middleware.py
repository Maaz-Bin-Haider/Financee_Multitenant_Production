tenancy.middleware
==================
Request-scoped tenant activation — the heart of the isolation guarantee.

For every request this middleware:

1. Resolves the schema for the authenticated user (via their Membership).
2. Issues ``SET search_path TO "<schema>", public`` on *this request's*
   database connection, at the very start of the request.
3. Always resets the path to ``public`` in a ``finally`` block, so a connection
   returned to the pool / reused by the worker never carries a previous
   request's tenant context.

Why this is thread-/request-safe
--------------------------------
* No module-level, global, or singleton tenant variable is ever written.
  The schema lives only on the local ``request`` object and on the connection
  for the duration of the request.
* Under Gunicorn sync workers each worker processes one request at a time on
  its own connection, so two tenants can never observe each other's
  ``search_path``. Even with persistent connections (CONN_MAX_AGE), the
  start-of-request SET overwrites any stale value before a single query runs.

Resolution rules
----------------
* Unauthenticated request                -> ``public`` (login pages, static).
* Authenticated, active membership+company -> the tenant schema.
* Authenticated, no membership (e.g. a fresh superuser) -> ``public``.

Superusers still land in ``public`` by default but ``public`` is always on the
path, so the custom admin keeps working; if a superuser is also given a
Membership they additionally get that tenant's business data in the UI.
